Library: A set of classes or modules with methods that are intended for use by other programs.
         An example is the Math library. Libraries are organised into packages. 
         E.g., the java.lang package includes the Math library among alot of others. 
         As a side note, a library can be just one class, but that
         class usually has multiple methods/modules that are used by many other Java programmers.

Package: http://www.leepoint.net/notes-java/language/10basics/import.html
         Package = directory. 
         Java classes/interfaces can be grouped together in packages. 
         A package name is the same as the directory (folder) name which contains the .java files. 
         You declare packages when you define your Java program, 
         and you name the packages you want to use from other libraries in an import statement.
